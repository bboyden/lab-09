  <h1>Lab 9: Release-Based Workflow with GitHub</h1>
  <p>This lab explored GitHub's release-based workflow by working through a self-directed GitHub Learning Lab course.</p>

  <h2>Key Skills Learned:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Created and explored a GitHub Learning Lab course repo</li>
    <li>Practiced opening, merging, and managing pull requests</li>
    <li>Learned how to create and tag releases using semantic versioning</li>
    <li>Generated automatic release notes</li>
    <li>Created and merged hotfixes into the release branch and main</li>
  </ul>
    <h2>My Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
  So this lab was super different, had no class, just me against GitHub Learning Lab. I learned how to create a release-based workflow using tags, pull requests, and hotfixes. It was kinda like real project stuff, and I got to see how versioning and branching works in bigger codebases. Took some time, but I actually learned a lot just clicking through and fixing stuff. Very real dev vibes. üõ†Ô∏è
